# stdgont
<p><b>Short description of the project.</b>
<p>Add Semantic Web ontology power to OpenRefine!
(Proof of concept/demonstration purposes only).
<p>Generate&use the Simplified Technical Dictionary Generic Ontology (STDGOnt) as OpenRefine operation JSON.
For example, to reconcile and enrich corporate material master data.

<p><b>Introduction.</b>
This project demonstrates a practical approach for reconciliation and enrichment of source messy data, processed by OpenRefine.
It just shows the concept and is not expected to be used in production environment.
<p>The project is partially inspired by a series of <a href="https://eccma.org/forms/webinar">ECCMA webinars</a>, devoted to data quality in supply chain.
<p>There are a number of sources, explaining how material master data quality impacts business, 
and there are a number of commercial and free solutions for improving of material master data quality.
This project demonstrates another one practical approach in this area as one of use cases.

<p><b>Source of poor material master data quality.</b>
Explained in ECCMA materials, and briefly in demonstration video.

<p><b>Solution design.</b>
The proposed solution includes the following components:
  <li> <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) application</a>
  <li> <a href="https://v1st.shinyapps.io/stdgont-app/">R Shiny application</a> to generate or reuse Simplified Technical Dictionary Generic Ontology (STDGOnt) JSON files and OpenRefine operation JSON 
  <li> Github Repository to keep and exchange by STDGOnt JSON files <a href="https://github.com/v1st-git/stdgont/">(this repository/project)</a>
<li> <a href="https://stdgont.uk.to/stdgont-openrefine-api-post1data">Semantic Web publishing service</a>/wrapper for SPARQL endpoint 
  <li> <a href="https://stdgont.uk.to/stdgont-fuzzy-search-api">Semantic Web fuzzy search service</a>/wrapper for SPARQL endpoint 
<li> SPARQL endpoint (internal service, is not available from Internet)

  <p><b>Three basic use cases:</b>
<li> Use OpenRefine and R Shiny STDGOnt application to create and publish STDGOnt ontology for further use in master data reconciliation and enrichment, based on fuzzy search
<li> Use R Shiny STDGOnt application to generate JSON for a set of OpenRefine operations based on STDGOnt fuzzy seach web service
<li> Use OpenRefine to get master data reconciled and structured by utilizing of JSON operations, created by R Shiny STDGOnt application
